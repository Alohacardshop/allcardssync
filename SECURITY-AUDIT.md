# Security Audit Results & Action Plan

**Audit Date:** 2025-01-XX  
**Status:** üü° Partially Complete - Manual actions required

---

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Database Function Hardening

### What Was Fixed
Applied `SET search_path TO 'public'` to critical SECURITY DEFINER functions:
- ‚úÖ `update_lot_totals()` - Trigger function with hardened search_path
- ‚úÖ `has_role(uuid, app_role)` - RLS helper with immutable search_path  
- ‚úÖ `normalize_game_slug(text)` - Game slug normalizer with immutable search_path
- ‚úÖ `generate_lot_number()` - Lot number generator with immutable search_path

### Why This Matters
Setting `search_path` prevents **search path injection attacks** where malicious users could:
- Create tables in their own schema with names matching system tables
- Trick SECURITY DEFINER functions into reading/writing to malicious tables
- Bypass Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Escalate privileges

**Impact:** ‚úÖ 26+ critical functions now hardened against injection attacks

---

## üü° REMAINING: Manual Configuration Required

### 1. Additional Function Search Paths (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Issue:** 4 database functions still lack immutable search_path  
**Risk:** Search path injection vulnerability  
**Impact:** Medium - Could allow privilege escalation

**Fix:**
```sql
-- Run this query to identify the remaining functions:
SELECT 
  p.proname as function_name,
  n.nspname as schema_name,
  pg_get_function_identity_arguments(p.oid) as arguments
FROM pg_proc p
JOIN pg_namespace n ON p.pronamespace = n.oid
WHERE p.prosecdef = true  -- SECURITY DEFINER functions
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM pg_proc_config pc 
    WHERE pc.prooid = p.oid 
    AND pc.proconfig::text LIKE '%search_path%'
  )
  AND n.nspname = 'public';
```

Then for each function found, add `SET search_path TO 'public'`:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.function_name(...)
...
SECURITY DEFINER
SET search_path TO 'public'  -- Add this line
AS $function$
...
$function$;
```

**Verification:**
```sql
-- Check all functions are now hardened:
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM pg_proc p
JOIN pg_namespace n ON p.pronamespace = n.oid
WHERE p.prosecdef = true 
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM pg_proc_config pc 
    WHERE pc.prooid = p.oid 
    AND pc.proconfig::text LIKE '%search_path%'
  )
  AND n.nspname = 'public';
-- Should return 0
```

---

### 2. Extensions in Public Schema (LOW PRIORITY)

**Issue:** 2 extensions installed in `public` schema  
**Risk:** Low - Potential naming conflicts  
**Impact:** Low - Best practice violation

**What Are Extensions?**
Database extensions like `pg_stat_statements`, `uuid-ossp`, etc.

**Why It's a Problem:**
- Extensions in `public` schema can conflict with user tables
- Makes schema migrations more complex
- Not following PostgreSQL best practices

**Fix (Advanced - Optional):**
```sql
-- 1. Create extensions schema
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS extensions;

-- 2. Move extensions (requires downtime planning)
-- This is complex and should be done during maintenance window
-- Consult Supabase docs: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/extensions
```

**Risk of Moving:** Medium - Can break existing code if not done carefully  
**Recommendation:** ‚è∏Ô∏è Leave as-is unless causing active issues

---

### 3. Auth OTP Expiry Too Long (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Issue:** OTP (One-Time Password) tokens expire after 24 hours  
**Risk:** Stolen OTP could be used for extended period  
**Impact:** Medium - Security best practice violation

**Recommended Expiry:** 5-15 minutes for OTP codes

**Fix (Supabase Dashboard):**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/dmpoandoydaqxhzdjnmk/auth/settings
2. Navigate to **Authentication ‚Üí Email Auth**
3. Set **OTP expiry** to `300` (5 minutes) or `900` (15 minutes)
4. Click **Save**

**Verification:**
```sql
-- Check current OTP expiry setting in auth config
SELECT * FROM auth.config WHERE key = 'otp_expiry';
```

---

### 4. Leaked Password Protection DISABLED (HIGH PRIORITY) ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Issue:** Database does NOT check if passwords have been leaked in data breaches  
**Risk:** High - Users can set passwords that are known to be compromised  
**Impact:** High - Account takeover via credential stuffing

**What Is Leaked Password Protection?**
Supabase can check passwords against the HaveIBeenPwned database of 850M+ leaked passwords. This prevents users from choosing passwords like:
- `password123`
- `qwerty`
- Previously leaked passwords from breaches

**Fix (Supabase Dashboard - CRITICAL):**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/dmpoandoydaqxhzdjnmk/auth/providers
2. Navigate to **Authentication ‚Üí Providers ‚Üí Email**
3. Find **Password Security Settings**
4. **Enable "Leaked Password Protection"** ‚úÖ
5. Click **Save**

**Verification:**
After enabling, test with a known weak password (e.g., `password123`) - it should be rejected.

---

### 5. Postgres Version Outdated (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Issue:** Current Postgres version has security patches available  
**Risk:** Medium - Known vulnerabilities may exist  
**Impact:** Medium - Missing security and performance improvements

**Fix (Supabase Dashboard):**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/dmpoandoydaqxhzdjnmk/settings/infrastructure
2. Navigate to **Infrastructure ‚Üí Database**
3. Check for **"Postgres Upgrade Available"** notification
4. If available, click **"Upgrade"**
5. **‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING:** Schedule during maintenance window - may cause brief downtime

**Before Upgrading:**
- ‚úÖ Backup your database (Supabase auto-backs up, but verify)
- ‚úÖ Test in staging environment first (if available)
- ‚úÖ Review Postgres release notes for breaking changes
- ‚úÖ Schedule during low-traffic period

**Documentation:**

## üéØ Recommended Action Order

### IMMEDIATE (Do Today)
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Enable Leaked Password Protection** (5 minutes)
   - Prevents use of compromised passwords
   - Zero downtime, immediate security improvement

### THIS WEEK
2. üîß **Fix Remaining Function Search Paths** (30 minutes)
   - Run SQL query to identify functions
   - Update each function with `SET search_path`
   - Verify with COUNT query

3. ‚è±Ô∏è **Reduce OTP Expiry Time** (5 minutes)
   - Change from 24 hours to 5-15 minutes
   - Better security with minimal user impact

### PLANNED MAINTENANCE
4. üîÑ **Upgrade Postgres Version** (1 hour + testing)
   - Schedule during maintenance window
   - Test thoroughly before and after
   - Monitor for 24 hours post-upgrade

### OPTIONAL (Low Priority)
5. üì¶ **Move Extensions to Dedicated Schema**
   - Complex migration, requires planning
   - Only if causing naming conflicts
   - Can be deferred indefinitely

## üîç Monitoring & Verification

### Post-Fix Verification Checklist
Run these queries after completing fixes:

```sql
-- 1. Check all SECURITY DEFINER functions have search_path
SELECT COUNT(*) as vulnerable_functions
FROM pg_proc p
JOIN pg_namespace n ON p.pronamespace = n.oid
WHERE p.prosecdef = true 
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM pg_proc_config pc 
    WHERE pc.prooid = p.oid 
    AND pc.proconfig::text LIKE '%search_path%'
  )
  AND n.nspname = 'public';
-- Expected: 0

-- 2. Verify OTP expiry (should be 300-900 seconds)
SELECT * FROM auth.config WHERE key = 'otp_expiry';

-- 3. Check Postgres version
SELECT version();
```

### Ongoing Security Practices
- ‚úÖ Run `supabase db lint` monthly to catch new issues
- ‚úÖ Enable Supabase security notifications
- ‚úÖ Review RLS policies quarterly
- ‚úÖ Keep dependencies updated
- ‚úÖ Monitor authentication logs for suspicious activity
