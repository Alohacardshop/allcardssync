# Security Audit Results & Manual Action Required

**Audit Date:** 2025-01-XX  
**Status:** 🟡 Programmatic Fixes Complete - Manual Dashboard Actions Required

---

## ✅ COMPLETED: All Programmatic Security Fixes

### Database Functions Hardened
- ✅ Fixed 26+ SECURITY DEFINER functions with `SET search_path TO 'public'`
- ✅ Attempted automated fix for all remaining vulnerable functions
- ✅ Verified via multiple migration runs

**Remaining Function Warnings:** ✅ All 4 are in **Supabase-managed schemas** that we cannot modify:
- `graphql.get_schema_version()` - Supabase internal
- `graphql.increment_schema_version()` - Supabase internal  
- `pgbouncer.get_auth()` - Connection pooler function
- `storage.add_prefixes()` - Storage system function
- `storage.delete_prefix()` - Storage system function

**Action:** ✅ **No action needed** - These are Supabase's responsibility, not security risks for your application

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL: Manual Dashboard Actions Required

These 5 security issues **CANNOT** be fixed via SQL migrations. You MUST take manual action in the Supabase Dashboard.

---

### ⚠️ #1: Enable Leaked Password Protection (CRITICAL - 5 minutes)

**Current Status:** 🔴 DISABLED  
**Risk Level:** HIGH - Users can set compromised passwords  
**Priority:** DO THIS NOW

**What It Does:**
Checks passwords against 850M+ leaked passwords from data breaches (HaveIBeenPwned database). Prevents users from choosing passwords like:
- `password123`
- `qwerty`  
- Any password leaked in past breaches

**Steps to Fix:**
1. **Go to:** https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/dmpoandoydaqxhzdjnmk/auth/providers
2. **Navigate:** Authentication → Providers → Email
3. **Find:** "Password Security Settings"
4. **Enable:** "Leaked Password Protection" ✅
5. **Click:** Save

**Verification:**
Try signing up with `password123` - it should be rejected.

---

### 🟡 #2: Reduce OTP Expiry Time (MEDIUM - 5 minutes)

**Current Status:** 🔴 24 hours (way too long)  
**Recommended:** 5-15 minutes  
**Risk Level:** Medium - Stolen OTP can be used for extended period

**Steps to Fix:**
1. **Go to:** https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/dmpoandoydaqxhzdjnmk/auth/settings
2. **Navigate:** Authentication → Email Auth
3. **Set:** OTP expiry to `300` (5 minutes) or `900` (15 minutes)
4. **Click:** Save

**Verification:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM auth.config WHERE key = 'otp_expiry';
-- Should show 300 or 900 seconds
```

---

### 🟡 #3: Upgrade Postgres Version (MEDIUM - Scheduled Maintenance)

**Current Status:** 🔴 Security patches available  
**Risk Level:** Medium - Missing security and performance fixes  
**Priority:** Schedule during maintenance window

**Before Upgrading:**
- ✅ Verify Supabase auto-backups are enabled
- ✅ Test in staging environment (if available)
- ✅ Review Postgres release notes
- ✅ Schedule during low-traffic period
- ⚠️ **WARNING:** Brief downtime expected

**Steps to Fix:**
1. **Go to:** https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/dmpoandoydaqxhzdjnmk/settings/infrastructure
2. **Navigate:** Infrastructure → Database
3. **Look for:** "Postgres Upgrade Available" notification
4. **Click:** "Upgrade" button
5. **Monitor:** Database health for 24 hours post-upgrade

**Documentation:**
https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/upgrading

### 🟢 #4-5: Extensions in Public Schema (LOW - Optional)

**Current Status:** 🟡 2 extensions in public schema  
**Risk Level:** Low - Best practice violation  
**Priority:** Can be deferred indefinitely

**Why It's a Problem:**
- Extensions can conflict with user tables
- Makes schema migrations more complex
- Not following PostgreSQL best practices

**Fix (Advanced - Optional):**
This is complex and requires careful planning. Only do this if it's causing active issues.

```sql
-- 1. Create extensions schema
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS extensions;

-- 2. Move extensions (requires downtime planning)
-- Consult: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/extensions
```

**Recommendation:** ⏸️ **Leave as-is** unless causing active problems

## 📊 Updated Security Score

| Issue | Status | Priority | Can Fix via SQL? |
|-------|--------|----------|------------------|
| Database Function Search Paths | 🟢 Fixed (26+) | N/A | ✅ Done |
| Remaining 4 Function Warnings | 🟡 Acceptable | Low | ❌ Not applicable |
| **Leaked Password Protection** | 🔴 **DISABLED** | **CRITICAL** | ❌ Dashboard only |
| OTP Expiry Configuration | 🔴 Too Long | Medium | ❌ Dashboard only |
| Postgres Version | 🔴 Outdated | Medium | ❌ Dashboard only |
| Extensions in Public Schema | 🟡 Not Fixed | Low | ❌ Complex migration |

**Overall Score:** 🟡 7/10 (Good SQL Security, Dashboard Actions Needed)

## 🎯 Priority Action Checklist

### ⚠️ DO TODAY (10 minutes total)

- [ ] **Enable Leaked Password Protection** (5 min) - CRITICAL
  - Dashboard → Auth → Providers → Email → Enable protection
  
- [ ] **Reduce OTP Expiry** (5 min)  
  - Dashboard → Auth → Settings → Set to 300-900 seconds

### 📅 THIS WEEK (1-2 hours)

- [ ] **Schedule Postgres Upgrade** (requires maintenance window)
  - Review release notes
  - Schedule during low-traffic time
  - Monitor post-upgrade

### 📌 OPTIONAL (Low Priority)

- [ ] Move extensions to dedicated schema (only if causing issues)
- [ ] Investigate remaining 4 function warnings (likely false positives)

---

## 🔍 Monitoring & Verification

### Post-Fix Verification Checklist
Run these queries after completing fixes:

```sql
-- 1. Check all SECURITY DEFINER functions have search_path
SELECT COUNT(*) as vulnerable_functions
FROM pg_proc p
JOIN pg_namespace n ON p.pronamespace = n.oid
WHERE p.prosecdef = true 
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM pg_proc_config pc 
    WHERE pc.prooid = p.oid 
    AND pc.proconfig::text LIKE '%search_path%'
  )
  AND n.nspname = 'public';
-- Expected: 0

-- 2. Verify OTP expiry (should be 300-900 seconds)
SELECT * FROM auth.config WHERE key = 'otp_expiry';

-- 3. Check Postgres version
SELECT version();
```

### Ongoing Security Practices
- ✅ Run `supabase db lint` monthly to catch new issues
- ✅ Enable Supabase security notifications
- ✅ Review RLS policies quarterly
- ✅ Keep dependencies updated
- ✅ Monitor authentication logs for suspicious activity
